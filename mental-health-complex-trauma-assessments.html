          <p class="mb-7">This is a comprehensive evaluation that includes recommendations for service provisions. Assessment scales are used to gain a better understanding of a youth's personality, intellectual capacity, development, protective factors, competency development, vulnerabilities for risk of youth violence and elements of sexually harmful behavior. This evaluation may serve as a guide to make recommendations for dispositions, service delivery and safety plans.</p>

          <h2 class="card-title text-success mb-4">Complex Trauma Evaluation</h2>

          <p>Our Certified Trauma Professionals provide Psycho-Traumatology Evaluations for diagnosing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPSTD). These evaluations also address the criteria for stabilization, identifying vulnerabilities in families at-risk, as well as elements for optimal child development.</p>

          <p class="mb-7">The importance of PTSD and accuracy of a trauma diagnosis are paramount, especially when it is associated with other co-morbid diagnosis such as depression, alcohol/ substance abuse, anxiety disorders and some personality disorders, as untreated PTSD may progress to chronic mental illness. The effects of trauma and complex trauma can cause impairment that limits a child's ability to perform life activities such as eating, sleeping, concentrating, thinking, communicating, learning and emotional self-regulation.Our assessments comport with the prevailing standards of care for assessing trauma-impacted youth. </p>

          <h2 class="card-title text-success mb-4">Comprehensive Mental Health &amp; Level of Care Assessments</h2>
