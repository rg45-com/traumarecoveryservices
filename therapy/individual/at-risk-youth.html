            <p class="text-dark font-size-15 mb-4">Our licensed therapists specialize in treating At-Risk Youth. We want to help these children stay in the community without the need to go to higher levels of care, such as residential and acute care settings.</p>

            <p class="text-dark font-size-15 mb-4">Some children and adolescents struggle with Severe Emotional Disturbance (SED) and/or Severe Mental Illness (SMI). Our therapists specialize in treating these kids. We are here to support children and teens who struggle with trauma and abuse, suicidal ideation and self harming behavior, substance dependence, trafficking and prostitution, and attachment problems.</p>
            
            <p class="text-dark font-size-15 mb-4">Our goal is to help these kids to develop healthy ways to manage symptoms and cope with stressors to the best of their abilities.</p>
